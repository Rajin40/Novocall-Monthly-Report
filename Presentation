By following the insights we analysed that the company NOVOCALL's monthly performance from January to December is average .
In us month February the company spent 814.8$ and their revenue is 1248$ . So that is good performance for the monthly revenue as they spent.But not so high.
In next months their revenue is not so good as February . But they are not in loss . In August to October they are in loss and spent money .
In November and December they again started to earn revenue . So we can say that their spent rate is good but not so high as website clicks and impressions. 
But they also need to increase website clicks and impressions by modifying their strategy . 
Because strategy is the main concept for growing . We recommend that they should modify their strategy and focus in their sells growth
